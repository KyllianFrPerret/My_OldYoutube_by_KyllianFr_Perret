LYRICS<br><br>

Look at this photograph<br>
Every time I do it makes me laugh<br>
How did our eyes get so red?<br>
And what the hell is on Joey's head?<br><br>

And this is where I grew up<br>
I think the present owner fixed it up<br>
I never knew we'd ever went without<br>
The second floor is hard for sneaking out<br><br>

And this is where I went to school<br>
Most of the time had better things to do<br>
Criminal record says I broke in twice<br>
I must have done it half a dozen times<br><br>

I wonder if it's too late<br>
Should I go back and try to graduate?<br>
Life's better now than it was back then<br>
If I was them I wouldn't let me in<br><br>

Oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, god, I<br><br>

Every memory of looking out the back door<br>
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br>
Every memory of walking out the front door<br>
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br><br>

Remember the old arcade<br>
Blew every dollar that we ever made<br>
The cops hated us hangin' out<br>
They say somebody went and burned it down<br><br>

We used to listen to the radio<br>
And sing along with every song we know<br>
We said someday we'd find out how it feels<br>
To sing to more than just the steering wheel<br><br>

Kim's the first girl I kissed<br>
I was so nervous that I nearly missed<br>
She's had a couple of kids since then<br>
I haven't seen her since god knows when<br><br>

Oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, god, I<br><br>

Every memory of looking out the back door<br>
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br>
Every memory of walking out the front door<br>
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br><br>

I miss that town<br>
I miss the faces<br>
You can't erase<br>
You can't replace it<br>
I miss it now<br>
I can't believe it<br>
So hard to stay<br>
Too hard to leave it<br><br>

If I could I relive those days<br>
I know the one thing that would never change<br><br>

Every memory of looking out the back door<br>
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br>
Every memory of walking out the front door<br>
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for<br>
It's hard to say it, time to say it<br>
Goodbye, goodbye.<br><br>

Look at this photograph<br>
Every time I do it makes me laugh<br>
Every time I do it makes me...<br>
